One comment: While we are using a dictionary that has 39,000 words, it is still missing a lot of words. For example, it doesn't think banana is a real word.
For this purpose, I suggest using this sentence: "hello this should work out for text. lol does not workk outt"
Only "lol" "workk" and "outt" should be marked as misspelled, i.e. red.
