A couple of comments for the project:

Dictionary: While we are using a dictionary that has 39,000 words, it is still missing a lot of words. For example, it doesn't think banana is a real word.
For this purpose, I sugest using this sentence: "this should work out for text. lol does not workk outt"
Only "lol" "workk" and "outt" should be marked as misspelled, i.e. red. 

Scrollbar: When scrolling down and back up, the page may appear blank. The letters will appear when typing again (even as simple as pressing space). We spoke to David 
and he said that would okay. David also said that he would allow us to use the scrollbar from SWT and not necessarily a glyph as described in the book.
